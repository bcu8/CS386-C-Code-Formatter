# C Code Formatter
Our system is a C code formatter which will recommend changes to a given .c file based on a series of pre-set guidelines; it will not directly change any files, only provide the user with recommendations to change parts of their code. Our system is an application that can format C code to specific guidelines that allows programmers to focus less on formatting and more on coding, prioritizing the quality of a program over the adherence to formatting guidelines. The C code formatter makes organization for programs easier.
