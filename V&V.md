# Description
Our system will allow the user to upload .c files to be analyzed by our code formatter algorithm. The website will provide feedback and suggestions for how the user can improve their code. The user will have an account on our website and all files uploaded will be stored for later download. The website has options for users to delete their file from the database. Our website also allows users to submit feedback to the developers.

# Verification (tests)
Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product. 

## Unit test

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.): **Jest**

Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located: [link](https://github.com/bcu8/CS386-C-Code-Formatter/blob/main/Testing_Environment/Testing%20Environment/methods.test.js)

# Reflections: 

Overall, our users enjoyed how easy to use and intuitive our system is. In addition to this, they enjoyed the format of the output and how accurate, consistent, and well-organized it is. When it comes to what they didnâ€™t like, the general consensus was that our system is not capable of handling as many limitations as some would like. One significant drawback was that our system struggles to handle large/complex c files.
