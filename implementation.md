### 2. Implemented requirements

**List in this section, the requirements (user stories, issues, or use cases) that you
implemented for this release. We expect that you implement/prototype features you
specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). Include who worked on each of the
features. We expect that all the members of the group have been involved in some
programming activities. BTW, we will check if you are using Trello to manage the
implementation tasks.**


### 3. Adopted technologies

**Include a list of adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for
choosing them.**

### 4. Learning/training

system in production. Remember that AWS Educate offers free credits for students. See
the tutorial at https://docker-curriculum.com/ on how to create a container and deploy
it on AWS. Provide a link for the system in production.**

### 6. Licensing

**Inform the license you adopted for your source code (remember to configure GitHub
accordingly) and why you adopted this license. For more information, check [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) and [http://redhat.slides.com/glikins/open-sourcelicensing-101#/](http://redhat.slides.com/glikins/open-sourcelicensing-101#/)**

### 7. Readme File

**You should also prepare your repository for receiving new contributors. See an example
of a Readme.md file at [https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
Besides the Readme.md file, your repository should contain a CONTRIBUTING.md
file, a LICENSE file, and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. Search online for some
examples of these files. In this section of the deliverable, put links to these files on GitHub.**
