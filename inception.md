# Project Inception

# 1. Introduction 

When writing code, keeping a neat and consistent format is key to preventing any spaghetti code. Our C code formatter is designed to work with specifically .c files and will automatically format files based on certain guidelines/rules. In addition to this, our formatter will keep track of which lines are formatted and inform the user where each change in the file was made. Users will upload their .c files to our database, which is where the formatter will format the user's file. 

Group 05 – “C Code Formatter ”  
Date and location: Feb 12, 2023  
Group Members: Kane Davidson, Ryley Fernandez, Nick Wiltshire, Ian Tuohy, Brandon Udall, and Ethan Ikhifa

#### * Save time formatting code 
#### * Increase code readibility
#### * Standardize a formatting strategy for individual or group work

# 3. Interviews summary

### Interview 1:

#### Summary: 

Joshua seemed to be very interested in a C code formatter. He mentioned how formatting is very important when writing programs. In addition to this, he does not need to be explicitly told to format his code since formatting is already a high priority for him. Finally, he relies on Visual Studio to automatically format his code as he writes it.

### Interview 2:

#### Summary: 

Interviewee has used C in a past class, where they need to follow certain GUR conventions. They haven't struggled with C formatting very much, it has become a part of their coding process, however, they would happily use a formatter to double check their work as to avoid losing points in the class. Although they do dedicate time to making sure formatting is correct, they haven't ever actually lost points due to any issues with it.

#### Interviewee: 

Braden

#### When: 

2/7/23

#### Key Insights: 

Interviewee doesn't struggle with formatting to the point where it is effecting his grade, but he would still use our product and it would be helpful to him in the long run.

#### Representative Quotes: 

"It's just part of the process." (In regards to code formatting)

#### Hypotheses that were validated: 

Computer Science majors would likely use our product to DOUBLE CHECK the formatting of their C code.

#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care: 

Nice to have

### Interview 3:

#### Summary: 

Interviewee has used C in a past class, where they need to follow certain GUR conventions. They also haven't struggled with C formatting very much, as it's also a part of their coding process. They claimed they would like to use the formatter as well. They have lost points due to formatting issues but not enough for it to severely effect their grade in their classes.

#### Interviewer: 

Nick

#### Interviewee: 

Drake

#### When: 

2/7/23

#### Consumer Segments:

Computer Science Student

#### Key Insights: 

Interviewee does lose points due to formatting, but not enough for it to be very significant. They would still like to use the formatter though, to double check their work, as well as to save time formatting.

#### Representative Quotes: 

"The most I've lost is maybe 5 points." (In regards to code formatting)

#### Hypotheses that were validated: 

Computer Science students could use our product to make sure they don't lose points on formatting issues. Although the product isn't necessarily necessary for them, it would still benefit them.

#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care: 

Nice to have

### Interview 4:

#### Summary: 

#### Interviewer: ethan ikhifa 
#### Interviewee: david knight
#### When: 02/08/23
#### Consumer Segments: 

Computer Science Student:

#### Key Insights: 

Interviewee has developed a well structured code style within the language C and does not struggle often with basic C conventions. Despite this, he does not start to struggle syntactically until working with double pointers. 


#### Representative Quotes: 

"When given a good IDE with a compiler writing basic c code isnt to hard." (In regards to c code deliverables)


#### Hypotheses that were validated: 

Not all students struggle with c code styling/formatting. basic conventions come natural to programmers with experience in C.

#### Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care: 

 Nice to have: 
 
 "in its current state its really nice to have. If it were to modifed to fit any c styling guide, 
  it would a must have." - Interviewee

### Interview 7:

**Summary:** Finds the idea of a general code formatter to be very useful, especially in consideration with classes general usage of assignments. 

**Interviewer:** Ryley F\
**Interviewee:** Meaghan F\
**When:** 2/11/2023
**Consumer Segments:** Computer Science Major

**Key insights**
  - Almost all CS classes have coding guideline to follow
  - Did not typically commit very many General Usage Rubric Violations
  - Though the Leverignton's GUR was relatively strict and stressful

 **Representative quotes**
  - “I spent at least an hour or two, though I have spent more, to format my code specifically or to double check if I left anything out”
  - “I lost more points from the GUR personally in CS136 as I got more used to the rubric in CS249”
  - “Yes, the majority, if not all my CS classes, have a guideline to follow for coding syntax”

 **Hypotheses that were validated**
  - A code formatter would be used especially in correlation with specific programming classes
  - The general usage rubric is very stressful and difficult to keep up with

 **Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
  - Nice to have
