# Project Inception

# 1. Introduction 

When writing code, keeping a neat and consistent format is key to preventing any spaghetti code. Our C code formatter is designed to work with specifically .c files and will automatically format files based on certain guidelines/rules. In addition to this, our formatter will keep track of which lines are formatted and inform the user where each change in the file was made. Users will upload their .c files to our database, which is where the formatter will format the user's file.

### Interview 1: 

#### Summary: 

Joshua seemed to be very interested in a C code formatter. He mentioned how formatting is very important when writing programs. In addition to this, he does not need to be explicitly told to format his code since formatting is already a high priority for him. Finally, he relies on Visual Studio to automatically format his code as he writes it.
