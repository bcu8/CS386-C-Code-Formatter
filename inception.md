**Summary:** Finds the idea of a general code formatter to be very useful, especially in consideration with classes general usage of assignments. 

**Interviewer:** Ryley F\
**Interviewee:** Meaghan F\
**When:** 2/11/2023
**Consumer Segments:** Computer Science Major

**Key insights**
  - Almost all CS classes have coding guideline to follow
  - Did not typically commit very many General Usage Rubric Violations
  - Though the Leverignton's GUR was relatively strict and stressful

 **Representative quotes**
  - “I spent at least an hour or two, though I have spent more, to format my code specifically or to double check if I left anything out”
  - “I lost more points from the GUR personally in CS136 as I got more used to the rubric in CS249”
  - “Yes, the majority, if not all my CS classes, have a guideline to follow for coding syntax”

 **Hypotheses that were validated**
  - A code formatter would be used especially in correlation with specific programming classes
  - The general usage rubric is very stressful and difficult to keep up with

 **Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
  - Nice to have
